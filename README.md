# Gene expression profiling of melanoma patients predicts responsiveness to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy

Melanoma is a highly dangerous form of skin cancer. While anti-PD-1 therapy has shown great promise in treating melanoma, with objective response rates of 35-40%, a significant fraction of patients do not respond to treatment. Consequently, an important challenge is the need for reliable biomarkers that can accurately identify which patients would benefit the most. Many promising gene expression signatures have been found to be associated with anti-PD-1 response, but their predictive values have rarely been validated. In this study, gene expression profiling data was analyzed from a public RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset of 27 pretreatment melanoma biopsies from patients who were treated with anti-PD-1 therapy. Differential gene expression analysis and hierarchical clustering identified a distinct gene expression profile associated with anti-PD-1 resistance. Furthermore, Gene Ontology pathway analysis and gene set enrichment analysis showed that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway were associated with anti-PD-1 resistance, and specific metabolic gene sets were enriched in the tumor cells of responders as well. These findings provide promising directions for the use of gene expression profiling in the clinic and suggest potential targets for combination therapies to increase anti-PD-1 response rates.
